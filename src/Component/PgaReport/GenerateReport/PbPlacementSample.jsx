The Specialization Tracks have been categorized into Ambitious, Balanced and Casual based on the time you have for profile building, skills necessary to showcase interest in the respective specializations as well as the popularity and acceptance rate in these fields. These are merely meant to serve as guidelines and all of them are achievable if you put in the right efforts.",

All these courses will help you in building your profile. Do note that some of these are exploratory and are meant to help with your overall development. It is very much possible that during the next one year, your preferences might change. If you are not clear about your end goal, then it will be very hard to establish the career you want. Audit all the starter pack courses in depth to see if they offer the required skill set and technical depth.",
