If you are not clear about your end goal, then it will be very hard to establish the career you want. Check for job descriptions post the MS on the school websites and check out jobs that alumni hold. Do look at the syllabus in depth to see if they offer courses that provide the skill set and technical depth that you want. It is too early to decide your match and safe schools. However, these are some sample schools for you to get an idea of the course structure and technical depth of the programs.
